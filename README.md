**The first project named "Guess my number!" takes a number between 1 and 2 and compares it to the input value determined by the user. The code discusses three possible cases:**
<br/>
- There is no number in the input.
- The value matches the number and is correct.
- The value is wrong (either higher than the number or lower)

The game determines your current score in game and displays high score after every record.
<br/>
This game is a great opportunity for the beginners to learn conditional cases and get a good grip of javascript DOM manipulations.

**The second project named "Modal windows" is exactly what the title says.**
<br/>
- There are three buttons
- If the user clicks each of them, the window will pop up and the content around it will become blurry
- The window comes with a little x mark in order to close it (the user can also just click on the area around the window or the escape key to close it)

An excellent project for basic javascript students.
