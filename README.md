3 Javascript projects using basic knowledge
<br/>
**The first project named "Guess my number!" takes a number between 1 and 2 and compares it to the input value determined by the user. The code discusses three possible cases:**
<br/>
- There is no number in the input.
- The value matches the number and is correct.
- The value is wrong (either higher than the number or lower)
<br/>
The game determines your current score in game and displays high score after every record.
<br/>
This game is a great opportunity for the beginners to learn conditional cases and get a good grip of javascript DOM manipulations.
